## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I Learned

* placeholders are not accessible.
* It is an accessibility requirement to add labels to inputs
* When the interface does not allow for a visible label on the screen, then aria-label should be used.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued Development

  * Get more comfortable with SASS/SCSS
  * Learn the Command Line
  

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs | aria-placeholder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-placeholder) - This helped understand form accessibility a little better. 
- [MDN Web Docs | box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped to remind me how to utilize the different box-shadow attributes to obtain the desired effect.
